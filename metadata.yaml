description: "Amadís de Gaula (original Old Spanish and Galician-Portuguese spelling;\
  \ Spanish: Amadís de Gaula, IPA: [amaˈðiz ðe ˈɣaula]; Portuguese: Amadis de Gaula,\
  \ IPA: [ɐmɐˈdiʒ dɨ ˈɡawlɐ]) is a landmark work among the chivalric romances which\
  \ were in vogue in sixteenth-century Spain, although its first version, much revised\
  \ before printing, was written at the onset of the 14th century.\nThe earliest surviving\
  \ edition of the known text, by Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo (not Ordóñez de Montalvo),\
  \ was published in Zaragoza in 1508, although almost certainly there were earlier\
  \ printed editions, now lost. It was published in four books in Castilian, but its\
  \ origins are unclear: The narrative originates in the late post-Arthurian genre\
  \ and had certainly been read as early as the 14th century by the chancellor Pero\
  \ López de Ayala as well as his contemporary Pero Ferrús.\nMontalvo himself confesses\
  \ to have amended the first three volumes, and to be the author of the fourth. Additionally,\
  \ in the Portuguese Chronicle by Gomes Eannes de Azurara (1454), Amadis is attributed\
  \ to Vasco de Lobeira, who was knighted after the Battle of Aljubarrota (1385).\
  \ However, although other sources claim that the work was, in fact, a copy of one\
  \ João de Lobeira, not troubadour Vasco de Lobeira, and that it was a translation\
  \ into Castilian Spanish of an earlier work, probably from the beginning of the\
  \ 14th century, no primitive version in the original Portuguese is known. The inspiration\
  \ for the \"Amadis de Gaula\" appears to be the blocked marriage of Infanta Constanza\
  \ of Aragon with Henry of Castile in 1260 (see Juan Manuel's Libro de las tres razones\
  \ of 1335), as blocked was also Oriana's marriage to Amadis. A more recent opinion\
  \ attributes \"Amadis\" to Henry of Castile and León, due to evidence linking his\
  \ biography with the events in \"Amadis\". Henry of Castile died in 1305.\nIn his\
  \ introduction to the text, Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo explains that he has edited\
  \ the first three books of a text in circulation since the 14th century. Montalvo\
  \ also admits to adding a fourth as yet unpublished book as well as adding a continuation\
  \ (Las sergas de Esplandián), which he claims was found in a buried chest in Constantinople\
  \ and transported to Spain by a Hungarian merchant (the famous motif of the found\
  \ manuscript).\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
